Introduction

Supply chain disruptions can have severe consequences on businesses, including delays in production, increased costs, and customer dissatisfaction. This repository aims to provide Python codes that can assist in analyzing and mitigating the impact of disruptions on supply chains. By leveraging these codes, users can gain insights into potential vulnerabilities, test different mitigation strategies, and evaluate their effectiveness.

Features

Disruption Modeling: The codes include various models for simulating supply chain disruptions, such as natural disasters, transportation failures, and supplier bankruptcies. These models can be customized and extended to match specific supply chain scenarios.
Impact Analysis: Users can evaluate the impact of disruptions on different aspects of the supply chain, including inventory levels, production schedules, and customer orders. The codes provide metrics and visualizations to quantify and visualize the effects of disruptions.
Mitigation Strategies: The repository includes examples of different mitigation strategies, such as inventory buffering, dual sourcing, and alternative routing. These strategies can be tested and adapted to assess their effectiveness in minimizing the impact of disruptions.
